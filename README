# eselect-wine

eselect-wine finds installed wine versions by looking for folders named `wine-*` in `$PREFIX` that contain a file `bin/wine`.
Additionally, it relies on the existance of launcher scripts for the various wine executables in `$BINDIR` with the same suffix as the corresponding folder in `$PREFIX`.

Suffixes matching `$VARIANTS` will cause issues.

Wine should be installed with the following arguments passed to `configure`:

    --prefix="${PREFIX}/wine-${suffix}" \
    --datadir="${PREFIX}/wine-${suffix}" \
    --mandir="${PREFIX}/wine-${suffix}/man"

## "Dry" testing
For the most basic usage, the directory ${PREFIX}/wine-XXX and the files ${PREFIX}/wine-XXX and ${BINDIR}/wine-XXX must exist.
